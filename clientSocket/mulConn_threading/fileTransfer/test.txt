How to Transfer Files Over TCP?
✅ Client reads a file and sends it in chunks
✅ Server receives the file and writes it to disk
✅ Uses TCP sockets (send() and recv()) to handle the transfer

1️⃣ Server Code (Run on Raspberry Pi)
Save this as server.py on your Pi:

python
Copy
Edit
import socket

# Server IP & Port
HOST = "0.0.0.0"  # Listen on all interfaces
PORT = 12345  

# Create socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
server_socket.listen(1)

print("Waiting for connection...")
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connected to {client_address}")

# Receive filename first
filename = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print(f"Receiving file: {filename}")

# Open file to write received data
with open(filename, "wb") as file:
    while True:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)  # Receive in chunks
        if not data:
            break
        file.write(data)  # Write to file

print(f"File {filename} received successfully!")

# Close sockets
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
2️⃣ Client Code (Run on Windows)
Save this as client.py on your Windows laptop:

python
Copy
Edit
import socket

# Server IP (Replace with your Raspberry Pi's IP)
SERVER_IP = "192.168.1.100"  # Change this to your Pi's IP
PORT = 12345  

# File to send
filename = "test_file.txt"  # Change this to your actual file

# Create socket
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((SERVER_IP, PORT))

# Send filename first
client_socket.send(filename.encode())

# Open file and send contents
with open(filename, "rb") as file:
    while chunk := file.read(1024):  # Read in 1024-byte chunks
        client_socket.send(chunk)

print(f"File {filename} sent successfully!")

# Close socket
client_socket.close()
📌 How to Run the File Transfer?
1️⃣ On Raspberry Pi (Server):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 server.py
2️⃣ On Windows (Client):

bash
Copy
Edit
python client.py
3️⃣ The file will be sent from Windows and saved on Raspberry Pi! 🎉

🔹 Next Steps?
Do you want to send files in both directions (Pi → Windows)?
Want to add progress bars for large file transfers?
Need secure transfers with encryption (TLS/SSL)?
Let me know, bro! 🚀🔥

This worked well Bro!!. Can we start multiple connections as per plan and then UDP and then our Phase 3

That's awesome, bro! 🔥🚀 Now, let’s move on to handling multiple client connections before diving into UDP.

📌 Multiple Clients with Threads
Right now, our server handles only one client at a time. To handle multiple clients simultaneously, we’ll use Python threads (threading module).

1️⃣ Multi-Client Server (Runs on Raspberry Pi)
Save this as server.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import socket
import threading

# Server IP & Port
HOST = "0.0.0.0"
PORT = 12345

# Create server socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind((HOST, PORT))
server_socket.listen(5)  # Allows up to 5 clients to wait in queue

print("Server is listening for multiple clients...")

# Function to handle each client
def handle_client(client_socket, client_address):
    print(f"New connection from {client_address}")
    
    # Receive and respond
    data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Received from {client_address}: {data}")
    client_socket.send(f"Hello, Client {client_address}!".encode())

    client_socket.close()

# Accept multiple clients
while True:
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    
    # Create a new thread for each client
    client_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket, client_address))
    client_thread.start()
2️⃣ Client Code (Runs on Windows, Multiple Instances)
Save this as client.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import socket

# Server IP & Port
SERVER_IP = "192.168.1.100"  # Change to your Pi's IP
PORT = 12345

# Create socket
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((SERVER_IP, PORT))

# Send data
client_socket.send("Hello from a client!".encode())

# Receive response
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print(f"Received from server: {response}")

client_socket.close()
📌 How to Test Multiple Clients?
1️⃣ Run the server first on Raspberry Pi

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 server.py
2️⃣ Run multiple client instances on Windows (or different devices)

Open multiple terminals and run client.py in each.
Each client will get a response from the server.
✅ Each client gets handled in a separate thread, so they can connect at the same time! 🎉

🔹 Next Steps?
Want to send files from multiple clients?
Want to broadcast messages to all clients (like a mini chat server)?
Or should we move to UDP communication next? 🚀🔥







You said:
On the server code, what is client_thread.start().
ChatGPT said:
Great question, bro! 🔥

The line client_thread.start() is used to start a new thread for each connected client, allowing multiple clients to be handled simultaneously instead of one at a time.

📌 What’s Happening?
python
Copy
Edit
client_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket, client_address))
client_thread.start()
🔹 threading.Thread() creates a new thread that runs the handle_client() function.
🔹 target=handle_client → The function that will run in the new thread.
🔹 args=(client_socket, client_address) → Arguments passed to the function.
🔹 client_thread.start() → Starts the new thread, handling the client without blocking the server.

📌 Why Do We Need start()?
Without start(), the server would process only one client at a time. The start() method runs each client in parallel, so the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously.

📌 What If We Used client_thread.run() Instead?
If we used:

python
Copy
Edit
client_thread.run()
The server would still handle one client at a time, because run() executes in the main thread instead of creating a new one.

📌 Example: Handling 3 Clients Without Threads vs. With Threads
❌ Without Threads (Blocking)
python
Copy
Edit
while True:
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    handle_client(client_socket, client_address)  # Blocks further connections
🚫 Next client has to wait until the previous one is done.

✅ With Threads (Non-Blocking)
python
Copy
Edit
while True:
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    client_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket, client_address))
    client_thread.start()
✅ Multiple clients can connect at the same time without waiting! 🎉

📌 Key Takeaways
client_thread.start() → Runs handle_client() in a new thread, allowing parallel processing.
Multiple clients can connect at the same time without waiting.
Without threads, each client would have to wait for the previous one to finish.
🔹 Next Steps?
Now that you understand multi-threading, should we:
1️⃣ Transfer files from multiple clients?
2️⃣ Move to UDP communication?

Awesome, bro! 🔥💯 Go ahead and test file transfers from multiple clients. If you run into any issues or need improvements (like handling simultaneous file writes or progress tracking), just hit me up! 🚀

Once you're done, we’ll move to UDP communication as planned. Looking forward to your update! 🤜🤛
